### Part 1: Make a personalized slide

1. Using PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides, create a single-page landscape mode **PDF** that contains the following information.

* Your name as it appears in Canvas.
* The name you prefer to be called.
* A recent photo of you to help me learn what you look like.

2. Submit this **PDF** to Canvas for Problem Set 1. *Note: You will not get full credit if you submit a PowerPoint or a link to a Google Slides presentation. You must submit a **PDF**.*

### Part 2: Take the course survey
[Take this short survey.](https://forms.gle/P6YQDRKZX2HxS7D37)

### Part 3: Get started on Slack
[Follow this link to join the Slack organization for this class](https://join.slack.com/t/csci1101-05fall22/shared_invite/zt-1f065l9zo-55jcSfX5olRbRQotioT58w). Create your account if you don't have one and feel free to use a pseudonym for your username. Then post a message in the #general channel. Don't forget to @prudhome if you need my attention.

### Part 4: Log into our remote linux server
You should have received an email from our systems administrator, Phil Temples, with a username and password for the CS Lab server. If you have not received this email yet, email me (prudhome@bc.edu) right away. You will be using a program called ssh to access our linux server. Mac users already have ssh installed as part of the Terminal application. Windows users will have to jump through hoops to get access to ssh. Please see the instructions below under Windows Users.


#### 4a. Mac Users
Launch the Terminal application. If you are not sure how to find the Terminal application, you can find it by going up to the magnifying glass in the upper right corner of your screen and then entering "Terminal" in the search bar. The Terminal app will show up in a list of things matching your search. Click on it, and the Terminal app will launch. You will see a Terminal window like this.


#### 4b. Windows Users

One of the following things should get ssh ready to go. Unfortunately, since Windows machines are all different, depending on how the manufacturer of the computer decided to configure things, there's no way for me to know which of the following will work for you.

* Check to see if you have SSH already installed on your computer. Follow these instructions to open a Command window, and then type `ssh`. If it says something like "command not found" then you don't already have ssh installed. If it says something like "usage: blah blah...", then you do have ssh installed. Proceed to 4c, below.
* If that didn't work, Install the Windows Linux Subsystem [as described here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
* If you aren't able to install Windows Linux Subsystem yourself, go to the [help center in O'Neill Library](https://libguides.bc.edu/oneill-tech-help) and tell them you need to install or activate the Windows Linux Subsystem on your computer.
* If they can't help you, see if you can install the [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).
* Finally, if none of those things work, then install [this very trusted third-party app, Putty](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/install).



### Part 5: Try out some unix commands!

1. 

5. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing that you typed these commands, and submit it to the Canvas assignment for Problem Set 1.

### Part 6: Creat a screen capture video
